This is a short exercise to test your frontend skills. Please complete it with React.

## The task

You will build a simple notes app. 

We've already uploaded the necessary boilerplate for you (React components + CSS).

Your goal is to implement all the remaining TODOs.

## Before you get started

### If you run into a problem

1. **Open a [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/issues\/tracking-your-work-with-issues\/creating-an-issue):** Simply go to the "Issues" tab in this repository and click on "New issue".
2. **Describe Your Issue:** Briefly describe the problem you are encountering. Include key details like error messages or steps to reproduce the issue. This helps us understand and resolve your concern more efficiently.
3. **Automated Support:** Initially, our support bot will try to resolve your issue. If it is unable to help, a member of the Alva team will be notified and will step in to assist you.

**Note:** it is important to close the issue once your problem is resolved, open issues may indicate to the hiring team that your assignment is not yet ready for review.

### Working in a Gitpod environment

If you prefer to avoid installing dependencies like Docker or npm on your local machine, Gitpod offers a handy solution. It provides free access to preconfigured, in-browser IDEs that are ready for immediate use.

To utilize this for your repository, here's what you need to do:

1. Go to 'https://gitpod.io/#your-repo-url', replacing 'your-repo-url' with the actual URL of your repository. For instance, 'https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World'.
2. Authenticate using your GitHub account.

By following these steps, you'll quickly find yourself in an environment tailored for your coding test.

### Try running the app and the tests locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
```

## What we expect from you

1. Implement all TODOs
2. Make the provided [tests](cypress/e2e/tests.cy.js) pass.
3. Push your code to the new `implementation` branch.
4. Create a new pull request, but please **do not merge it**.
5. Await further instructions from the hiring team.

### Time estimate ‚è≥

Between **15-30min** depending on your experience level + the time to set up the project/environment (go with one of the provided boilerplates to move quicker).

Also, there is no countdown. The estimate is for you to plan your time.
